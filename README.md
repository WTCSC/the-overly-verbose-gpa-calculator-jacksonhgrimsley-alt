**desription**
  
  -The Command-Line GPA Calculator is a lightweight, interactive tool designed to help students monitor and improve their academic performance directly from the terminal. It provides an efficient way to input, calculate, and analyze grades across multiple semesters without relying on web-based tools or spreadsheets..

**Requirements**
  
  -language= python
  
  -platform= visual studio code
  
  -storage	Local file (JSON/CSV) for the sentimental archivist
  
  -Error Handling	Politely refuses invalid grades and negative credits
  
**purpose**

  -to give a interactive way to calculate GPA with varying grades.

  -A way to see your GPA with humorous comments.
  
**Usage Examples**
  
  -When run, the program prompts the user for the number of classes (minimum 5), collects grade inputs, calculates the overall GPA, and analyzes either the first or second half of the semester. It also lets users input a goal GPA and suggests ways to improve individual grades to meet that goal.

**Configuration & Testing**

  -No external configuration is needed; all inputs are entered via prompts. To test, simply run the script and follow the prompts—try entering valid/invalid grades, and different goal GPAs to see how the program responds.
