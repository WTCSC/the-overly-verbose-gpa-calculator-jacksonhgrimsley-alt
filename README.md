**desription
  *This is a command-line GPA calculator that helps students track their academic performance. It allows users to input grades, analyze GPA for different semesters, and check what improvements are needed to reach a target GPA.

**Requirements
  *python
  *visual studio code

**Installation
  *No installation is required beyond having Python 3 installed. Simply copy the script into a .py file and run it using a Python interpreter (python filename.py).

**Usage Examples
  *When run, the program prompts the user for the number of classes (minimum 5), collects grade inputs, calculates the overall GPA, and analyzes either the first or second half of the semester. It also lets users input a goal GPA and suggests ways to improve individual grades to meet that goal.

**Configuration & Testing
  *No external configuration is needed; all inputs are entered via prompts. To test, simply run the script and follow the promptsâ€”try entering valid/invalid grades, and different goal GPAs to see how the program responds.
